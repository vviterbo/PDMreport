Powder x-ray diffraction studies of the highly crystalline products (C3H2BO)6·(C9H12)1 (COF-1) and C9H4BO2 (COF-5) revealed expanded porous graphitic layers that are either staggered (COF-1, P63/mmc) or eclipsed (COF-5, P6/mmm). Their crystal structures are entirely held by strong bonds between B, C, and O atoms to form rigid porous architectures with pore sizes ranging from 7 to 27 angstroms. COF-1 and COF-5 exhibit high thermal stability (to temperatures up to 500° to 600°C), permanent porosity, and high surface areas (711 and 1590 square meters per gram, respectively).
Condensation of organic boron compounds produces useful materials containing large pores that are stable to high temperatures and do not require linking metal atoms.

	abstract = {We propose a novel, special purpose semiempirical tight binding (TB) method for the calculation of structures, vibrational frequencies, and noncovalent interactions of large molecular systems with 1000 or more atoms. The functional form of the method is related to the self-consistent density functional TB scheme and mostly avoids element-pair-specific parameters. The parametrization covers all spd-block elements and the lanthanides up to Z = 86 using reference data at the hybrid density functional theory level. Key features of the Hamiltonian are the use of partially polarized Gaussian-type orbitals, a double-ζ orbital basis for hydrogen, atomic-shell charges, diagonal third-order charge fluctuations, coordination number-dependent energy levels, a noncovalent halogen-bond potential, and the well-established D3 dispersion correction. The accuracy of the method, called Geometry, Frequency, Noncovalent, eXtended TB (GFN-xTB), is extensively benchmarked for various systems in comparison with existing semiempirical approaches, and the method is applied to a few representative structural problems in chemistry.},

	abstract = {An extended semiempirical tight-binding model is presented, which is primarily designed for the fast calculation of structures and noncovalent interaction energies for molecular systems with roughly 1000 atoms. The essential novelty in this so-called GFN2-xTB method is the inclusion of anisotropic second order density ﬂuctuation eﬀects via shortrange damped interactions of cumulative atomic multipole moments. Without noticeable increase in the computational demands, this results in a less empirical and overall more physically sound method, which does not require any classical halogen or hydrogen bonding corrections and which relies solely on global and element-speciﬁc parameters (available up to radon, Z = 86). Moreover, the atomic partial charge dependent D4 London dispersion model is incorporated self-consistently, which can be naturally obtained in a tight-binding picture from second order density ﬂuctuations. Fully analytical and numerically precise gradients (nuclear forces) are implemented. The accuracy of the method is benchmarked for a wide variety of systems and compared with other semiempirical methods. Along with excellent performance for the “target” properties, we also ﬁnd lower errors for “oﬀ-target” properties such as barrier heights and molecular dipole moments. High computational eﬃciency along with the improved physics compared to its precursor GFN-xTB makes this method well-suited to explore the conformational space of molecular systems. Signiﬁcant improvements are furthermore observed for various benchmark sets, which are prototypical for biomolecular systems in aqueous solution.},

It is found that, surprisingly, UFF and DREIDING provide good values for the bulk modulus and linear thermal expansion coefficients for these materials, excluding those that they are not parametrized for. Force fields developed specifically for MOFs including UFF4MOF, BTW-FF, and the DWES force field are also found to provide accurate values for these materials’ properties. While we find that each force field offers a moderately good picture of these properties, noticeable deviations can be observed when looking at properties sensitive to framework vibrational modes. This observation is more pronounced upon the introduction of framework charges.},

The MOF electrostatic-potential-optimized charge scheme, or MEPO-QEq, was validated by evaluating the CO2 uptake and heats of adsorption in the 543 member training set and a nonoverlapping 693 member validation set. Compared with the results obtained from ab-initio-derived charges, the MEPO-QEq charges give Pearson (linear) and Spearman (rank-order) correlation coefficients of {\textgreater}0.97 for these two sets.

	title = {Fast {Parallel} {Algorithms} for {Short}–{Range} {Molecular} {Dynamics}},
	abstract = {Three parallel algorithms for classical molecular dynamics are presented. The ﬁrst assigns each processor a ﬁxed subset of atoms; the second assigns each a ﬁxed subset of inter–atomic forces to compute; the third assigns each a ﬁxed spatial region. The algorithms are suitable for molecular dynamics models which can be diﬃcult to parallelize eﬃciently — those with short–range forces where the neighbors of each atom change rapidly. They can be implemented on any distributed–memory parallel machine which allows for message–passing of data between independently executing processors. The algorithms are tested on a standard Lennard–Jones benchmark problem for system sizes ranging from 500 to 100,000,000 atoms on several parallel supercomputers — the nCUBE 2, Intel iPSC/860 and Paragon, and Cray T3D. Comparing the results to the fastest reported vectorized Cray Y–MP and C90 algorithm shows that the current generation of parallel machines is competitive with conventional vector supercomputers even for small problems. For large problems, the spatial algorithm achieves parallel eﬃciencies of 90\% and a 1840–node Intel Paragon performs up to 165 faster than a single Cray C90 processor. Trade–oﬀs between the three algorithms and guidelines for adapting them to more complex molecular dynamics simulations are also discussed.},

	abstract = {Time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) is a quantum mechanical framework which describes the dynamics of interacting electronic many-body systems formally exactly and in a computationally efficient manner. This book presents the concepts of TDDFT at the graduate level. An overview is given of the current state of the art of the field, with many applications in physics, (bio)chemistry, and materials science. The book begins with a self-contained review of ground-state density-functional theory, followed by four main parts. The first part presents the formal framework of TDDFT, beginning with the basic existence theorems of Runge, Gross, and van Leeuwen. The time-dependent Kohn-Sham scheme and the properties of the time-dependent exchange-correlation potential are then discussed in detail. The second part deals with the TDDFT formulation of linear-response theory, which can be used to calculate electronic excitation energies in principle exactly using the Casida equation. An overview is given of the performance of TDDFT for atomic and molecular excitation energies, with many examples. Special attention is paid to challenging cases such as double or charge-transfer excitations. The third part of the book focuses on further developments, including time-dependent current-density-functional theory, the optimized effective potential, and the connection to many-body theory. This part also deals with excitations in extended systems, such as plasmons and excitons. Several special TDDFT topics are discussed in part four: van der Waals interactions, nanoscale transport, strong-field phenomena, and coupled electron-nuclear motion and molecular dynamics. Additional resources are provided in several appendices.},
