	abstract = {Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been designed and successfully synthesized by condensation reactions of phenyl diboronic acid \{C6H4[B(OH)2]2\} and hexahydroxytriphenylene [C18H6(OH)6]. Powder x-ray diffraction studies of the highly crystalline products (C3H2BO)6·(C9H12)1 (COF-1) and C9H4BO2 (COF-5) revealed expanded porous graphitic layers that are either staggered (COF-1, P63/mmc) or eclipsed (COF-5, P6/mmm). Their crystal structures are entirely held by strong bonds between B, C, and O atoms to form rigid porous architectures with pore sizes ranging from 7 to 27 angstroms. COF-1 and COF-5 exhibit high thermal stability (to temperatures up to 500° to 600°C), permanent porosity, and high surface areas (711 and 1590 square meters per gram, respectively).
Condensation of organic boron compounds produces useful materials containing large pores that are stable to high temperatures and do not require linking metal atoms.
